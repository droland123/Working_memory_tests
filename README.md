# Working_memory_tests
This is a series of working  memory  tasks including a digit span task, operation span tasks, symmetry span task, and a visual array task. 

Each task can be started but opening the corrisponding html file. All data is savedd in the "save_data.php" file. 

Digit Span Task: The Digit Span Task is a cognitive assessment tool used to measure working memory capacity. Participants are presented with a sequence of digits and are asked to recall them in the same order or in reverse order.
The task assesses an individual's ability to hold and manipulate information in their immediate memory.

Operation Span Task: The Operation Span Task is a cognitive test that measures working memory capacity and cognitive control.
Participants are presented with a series of mathematical equations and are asked to solve them while simultaneously remembering a set of unrelated words. The task assesses an individual's ability to manage multiple cognitive processes and maintain information in working memory.

Symmetry Span Task: The Symmetry Span Task is a cognitive assessment that measures visual working memory and visuospatial processing.
Participants are presented with a series of stimuli consisting of symmetrical and non-symmetrical shapes.
They are asked to detect and remember the symmetry in the shapes while ignoring the non-symmetrical ones. The task assesses an individual's ability to process and remember visual information accurately.

Visual Array Task: The Visual Array Task is a cognitive test used to measure visual attention and perceptual processing.
Participants are presented with a display of multiple items (e.g., letters or shapes) for a brief period and are then asked to identify a target item or detect a change in the display. The task assesses an individual's ability to selectively attend to relevant visual stimuli and detect changes in a visual array.
